# Distributed Architecture for CT-Stream

This document outlines the architecture for scaling the CT-Stream application to handle high-volume certificate processing in a distributed environment.

## Current Limitations

The current single-process architecture has several limitations:

1. **Processing Capacity**: A single Node.js process can only handle a limited number of certificates per second
2. **Fault Tolerance**: If the process fails, certificate processing stops completely
3. **Resource Utilization**: Unable to utilize resources across multiple machines
4. **Horizontal Scaling**: No built-in mechanism to distribute work across instances

## Distributed Architecture Overview

The proposed distributed architecture transforms CT-Stream into a scalable system:

## Key Components

### 1. CT Collectors

Certificate Transparency collectors connect to CT log sources and publish entries to the message queue:

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Connect to CT log providers (CertStream, direct CT logs, etc.)
  - Perform initial validation and normalization
  - Publish certificates to the message queue
  - Handle connection retries and backoff
  - Report collection metrics

- **Scaling approach**:
  - Deploy multiple collectors for redundancy
  - Assign different CT log sources to different collectors
  - Implement load balancing across collectors

### 2. Message Queue

A message broker handles the distribution of certificates between collectors and processors:

- **Requirements**:
  - High throughput message passing
  - Persistent queues for fault tolerance
  - Support for multiple topics/partitions
  - Ability to replay messages if needed

- **Technology options**:
  - Apache Kafka
  - RabbitMQ
  - AWS SQS/SNS
  - Google Cloud Pub/Sub

- **Message structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "uuid-v4-certificate-id",
    "timestamp": "2023-04-01T12:34:56Z",
    "source": "certstream-1",
    "data": {
      // Certificate data
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. CT Processors

Worker nodes that consume certificates from the queue and perform processing:

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Consume certificates from the message queue
  - Check distributed cache for duplicates
  - Execute processing modules
  - Store results in the storage system
  - Update processing metrics

- **Scaling approach**:
  - Auto-scale based on queue depth

  - TTL support for expiring entries
  - High availability and fault tolerance
  - Sufficient memory capacity

- **Technology options**:
  - Redis
  - Memcached
  - Hazelcast
  - Custom distributed hash table

- **Usage patterns**:
  - Certificate fingerprint → Boolean (for deduplication)
  - Module result keys → JSON (for result caching)
  - Statistics counters → Number (for metrics)

### 5. Storage System

Persistent storage for certificates, processing results, and analytics:

- **Requirements**:
  - High write throughput
  - Flexible schema for different data types
  - Support for time-series data
  - Efficient querying capabilities

  - Elasticsearch for full-text search
  - MongoDB for document storage
  - S3/Blob storage for raw certificate data

- **Data organization**:
  - Certificates collection/table
  - Module results collection/table
  - Analytics and metrics collection/table

### 6. API Layer

A RESTful API for interacting with the system:

- **Endpoints**:
  - `/certificates` - Query and retrieve certificates
  - `/modules` - Manage and configure modules
  - `/stats` - System statistics and metrics
  - `/config` - System configuration

- **Implementation**:
  - Express.js or Fastify for API server
  - GraphQL for flexible querying
  - OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation

## Implementation Strategy

- **Storage System**: Scale based on retention period and query patterns

### Resource Requirements

| Component | CPU | Memory | Storage | Network |
|-----------|-----|--------|---------|---------|
| CT Collector | Low-Medium | Medium | Low | High |
| Message Queue | Medium | Medium-High | Medium-High | High |
| CT Processor | Medium-High | Medium-High | Low | Medium |
| Distributed Cache | Medium | High | Low | Medium |
| Storage System | Medium | Medium-High | High | Medium |
| API Layer | Low | Medium | Low | Medium |

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics

1. **Collection metrics**:
   - Certificates collected per second
   - Collection lag
   - Connection status to CT logs

2. **Processing metrics**:
   - Queue depth
   - Processing time per certificate
   - Module execution times
   - Error rates

3. **System metrics**:
   - CPU and memory usage
   - Network throughput
   - Disk I/O and usage
   - Cache hit rates

### Logging Strategy

- **Structured logging**: JSON-formatted logs with consistent fields
- **Correlation IDs**: Track certificates through the system
- **Log aggregation**: Centralized log collection and analysis
- **Log levels**: Configurable per component

### Dashboards

- **Operational dashboard**: System health and performance
- **Certificate dashboard**: Certificate volume and characteristics
- **Module dashboard**: Module performance and results
- **Alerting dashboard**: Alert history and status

## Failure Handling

### Failure Scenarios

1. **CT Collector failure**:
   - Other collectors continue operation
   - Failed collector automatically restarts
   - No certificate loss, possible temporary delay

2. **Message Queue failure**:
   - Messages persisted to disk
   - After recovery, processing continues from last point
   - Potential for duplicates, handled by deduplication

3. **CT Processor failure**:
   - Other processors continue operation
   - Failed processor's messages requeued
   - Automatic restart of failed processor

4. **Distributed Cache failure**:
   - Graceful degradation to non-cached operation
   - Rebuild cache from storage for critical components
   - Multiple cache nodes for redundancy

5. **Storage System failure**:
   - Read-only mode for API
   - Buffer writes in message queue
   - Resume writing when storage recovers

### Recovery Procedures

- **Automated recovery**: Self-healing components where possible
- **Manual procedures**: Documented recovery steps for complex failures
- **Data integrity checks**: Verify data consistency after recovery
- **Reconciliation jobs**: Fix inconsistencies between components

## Performance Considerations

### Bottlenecks

1. **Network bandwidth**: High volume of certificates requires significant bandwidth
2. **Message queue throughput**: Must handle peak certificate issuance periods
3. **Cache memory**: Must be sized for certificate volume and TTL requirements
4. **Storage write throughput**: Must handle continuous writes of certificate data

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Batch processing**: Group certificates for more efficient processing
2. **Data compression**: Compress certificate data to reduce storage and network usage
3. **Tiered storage**: Hot/warm/cold storage based on access patterns
4. **Selective processing**: Process only certificates matching specific criteria

## Security Considerations

1. **Network security**:
   - Internal network isolation
   - TLS for all communications
   - API authentication and authorization

2. **Data security**:
   - Encryption at rest for sensitive data
   - Access controls for storage systems
   - Audit logging for all operations

3. **Operational security**:
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular security updates
   - Vulnerability scanning

## Deployment Options

### Self-Hosted

- Docker Compose for small deployments
- Kubernetes for larger deployments
- On-premises or cloud infrastructure

### Cloud-Native

- AWS:
  - ECS/EKS for containers
  - SQS/SNS for messaging
  - ElastiCache for distributed cache
  - S3 and RDS/DynamoDB for storage

- Google Cloud:
  - GKE for containers
  - Pub/Sub for messaging

## Conclusion

This distributed architecture transforms CT-Stream from a single-process application into a scalable system capable of processing high volumes of certificates with fault tolerance and efficient resource utilization. By breaking the system into specialized components connected by a message queue, we enable independent scaling, improved resilience, and better resource allocation.

Implementation should proceed in phases, starting with the message queue integration and progressing through distributed caching, persistent storage, and finally deployment and orchestration. Each phase builds on the previous one and provides incremental value.
