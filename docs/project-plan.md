### Single-Process Deployment

For smaller deployments, a single process can handle the entire pipeline:

```
+-------------------+     +------------------+     +-----------------+
|                   |     |                  |     |                 |
| CertStream Source |---->| CT-Stream Process|---->| Output/Actions  |
|                   |     |                  |     |                 |
+-------------------+     +------------------+     +-----------------+
```

- Package as a Node.js application
- Provide Docker container
- Support configuration via environment variables
- Include monitoring endpoints

### Distributed Deployment

For high-volume processing, a distributed architecture provides scalability:

```
+---------------+     +--------------+     +----------------+
|               |     |              |     |                |
| CT Collectors |---->| Message Queue|---->| CT Processors  |
|               |     |              |     |                |
+---------------+     +--------------+     +----------------+
                                               |
                                               v
                                    +---------------------+
                                    |                     |
                                    | Storage/API Layer   |
                                    |                     |
